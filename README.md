# 3dgraphics
This repository contains my programming exercises and project code related to 3D computer graphics.

## Install
Install dependencies to compile and run the program

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev # 3D Computer Graphics from Scratch
```

## How to Run
To compile and run the main program (e.g., `src/main.c`), use the following command:
```
make build
make run
```
