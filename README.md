# 3dgraphics
This repository contains my programming exercises and project code related to 3D computer graphics. The work is based on `3D Computer Graphics from Scratch` by Gustavo Pezzi ([@Pikuma](https://www.pikuma.com)), along with additional explorations and personal projects.

## How to Run
To compile and run the main program (e.g., `src/main.c`), use the following command:
```
make build
make run
```

## Features
This repository includes (latest-first):
* Triangles and Vertices
* Fixed Time Step with Delay Function
* Linear Transformations
* Projection of Points: Orthographic, Isometric, and Perspective
* Vectors and Points using C Structs
* Modular structure with multiple header files
* Color buffer implementation for pixel-level drawing
* SDL setup for window creation and rendering
