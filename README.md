# 3dgraphics
This repository contains my programming exercises and project code related to 3D computer graphics.

## How to Run
To compile and run the main program (e.g., `src/main.c`), use the following command:
```
make build
make run
```

## Features (latest-first)
**Based on the course *3D Computer Graphics from Scratch* by Gustavo Pezzi ([@Pikuma](https://www.pikuma.com))**
* Dynamic Arrays and Reading OBJ File Content
* DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
* Triangles and Vertices
* Fixed Time Step with Delay Function
* Linear Transformations
* Projection of Points: Orthographic, Isometric, and Perspective
* Vectors and Points using C Structs
* Modular structure with multiple header files
* Color buffer implementation for pixel-level drawing
* SDL setup for window creation and rendering
